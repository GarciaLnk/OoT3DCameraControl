Free camera control hack for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D.
This tool scans the memory of Citra to find and modify the addresses corresponding to the LocalPlayer and LocalCamera.

The project can be compiled with Visual Studio.

It supports any controller supported by SDL:
- The right stick moves the camera
- The L button ("GAMEPAD_LEFT_SHOULDER") resets the angle of the camera
- The DPAD down button ("DPAD_DOWN") toggles the free camera control

Open citra-qt.exe and start the game, run the CameraOoT.exe once you can control Link.
